 * @remarks Imagine you don't want to modify a signal unless it's drops to zero or close to it, in which case you want to replace the value with a small possitive constant. Then, rather than clamping the value and introduce a discontinuity, you can smoothly blend the signal into the desired clipped value. So, let m be the threshold (anything above m stays unchanged), and n the value things will take when the signal is zero. Then, the following function does the soft clipping (in a cubic fashion).

This approach can be a bit slower than the cubic above, depending on the hardware, but I find myself using it a lot these days. While it has zero derivative, it has a non-zero second derivative, so keep an eye in case it causes problems in your application.

An extra nice thing is that this function can be used, unaltered, as an smooth-abs() function, which comes handy for symmetric funtions such as mirrored SDFs.

However, instead of having a 0 derivative at 1, it has a derivative of 1 at that point. It's equivalent to the Almost Identiy above with n=0 and m=1. Since it's a cubic just like smoothstep() it is very fast to evaluate:
